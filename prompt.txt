so, we are making a food management app that is slightly related to Snapchat features. It is based on a reward-based system. What will do is we'll create an app that is based on 5 days and 3 meals. the user will snap before and after a meal, and if the user tends to complete all the food without throwing it, then they will earn points which they can use as a gift card, in our case we'll associate with Sodexo so they can use the reward point within college cafeteria and Starbucks. So this is the basic idea of our app, but we'll have an additional feature that is badges and streaks. if user to other activities like cleaning gardens, or other sustainable development activities they'll earn badges and the badges to their number of streaks, if streaks are 100, they will have a bronze badge, or we can be creative on this and make something attractive. so this is the whole idea of our hackathons..if you want to add some extra features then you can suggest to..

so now the actual thing, my friend is making the basics of websites that its interface, and I'm working on all integration and APIs. so lets work on that noe..i need your full help..let rock it
